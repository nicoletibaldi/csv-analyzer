# Knack Coding Challenge
This project was created to solve the following problem:


## Setup:
Run `npm install` from within the project folder.


## Scripts:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the terminal. The user will be prompted to enter a file name, or press enter to use the default file (`test-contacts.csv`), as
provided. YMMV with other files, as there were obviously some assumptions made based on the content of `test-contacts.csv`. (Date format, for example.)

### `npm test`
Runs all tests in the `test` directory.

### `npm run lint`
Lints both the project and test files using Airbnb linting rules.
